GitWriter is a command-line tool that uses OpenAI's API to generate helpful and concise commit messages based on your staged git changes.

## Installation

```

## Usage

The GitWriter CLI provides the following commands:

`setup`: Set up the environment.

`env`: Load and display the current environment setup.

`test`: Test the environment.

`run`: Ensure the environment is set up and fetch staged Git changes.

## Commands
